Instructions:

There is a control and status register at register 20 in the COP0, which is used to check the instructions below. 
The existing Cause, Status, EPC, etc registers aren't read/write, or have a mixture of read/write bits which makes it difficult to test otherwise.
The Compare register could be used, but it is only a GPR, not a control register so can't check CTC / CFC, etc.

Each test is self-checking.
Each test is written in assembly.
